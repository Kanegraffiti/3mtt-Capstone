# Avatar Images

The following placeholder images must be added manually to `client/public/avatars/`:

- `avatar1.png`
- `avatar2.png`
- `avatar3.png`

Each image should be a square PNG (about 96x96) representing a simple user avatar. They are referenced by the `AvatarPicker` component on the Profile page.
