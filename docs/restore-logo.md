# Restore original logo

Due to repository constraints, the application logo cannot be stored in the repository.
After pulling the latest changes, manually add the logo file at:

```
client/public/logo.png
```

Use the version from commit `a09c3dc14139e50a5f1e11401d9572155342bcbb` (~1.4 MB file) to restore the original image. The logo is scaled to 64×64 via CSS, so no manual resizing is required.
